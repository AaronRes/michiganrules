    <h1>Greatest Wolverines Football Stretch in a Century</h1>
    <main>
    <p>After going through hard times, with occasional high points, the legendary <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Harbaugh">James Joseph Harbaugh</a> led his Wolverines to a National Championship and the first three of four victories over ohio.  These are my favorite moments from the past 4 years.</p>

        <li>Blake Corum takes it to the house following Zak Zinter's terrible injury on an inspired run</li>

        <li>Kalel Mullings converts a critical first down and more to seal the 2024 victory over the future national champs, whose seniors never beat Michigan.  Quite a shame.</li>

<aside>Now we await with baited breath the Sherrone Moore era, having bested ohio and alabama again, along with landing a young rockslinger in David Underwood.  The future is bright in Ann Arbor.  Go Blue!
